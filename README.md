# Serum History

Collects and aggregates trades from serum dex for display in a tradingview chart.
This is powering the charts on [mango.markets](https://mango.markets).
Feel free to improve and extend for the benefit for the larger solana ecosystem.

** Note: This does not include a functioning trading view to inspect the
data.** Check the [mango markets gui code](https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/mango-ui-v2/blob/main/components/TradingView/index.tsx) for a reference how to use this API to display a TradingView.
